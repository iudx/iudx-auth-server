<b>1. Introduction</b>

	Welcome to the <a href="https://www.iudx.org.in">IUDX</a> Authentication, Authentication, and Accounting (AAA) server.

	This server serves the IUDX AAA REST <a href="#apis">APIs</a> which can be called by:

		1. Data providers   (the resource owners)
		2. Data consumers   (users who wish to access one or more data provider's data)
		3. Resource servers (which hosts the data provider's data)

	through <a href="https://auth.iudx.org.in">HTTPS</a> (using a valid client-side <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a> certificate).

<b>2. Setup</b>

	<b><font color=red>[Note]</font></b> In the above setup, the <b>Resource server administrator</b> and the <b>Data provider</b> may also be the same person.

<b>3. Data access flow</b>

<b id=apis>4. List of APIs</b>

	 1. Get an access token (to be called by data consumers):
		<a href="token.txt">/auth/v1/token</a>

	 2. Set access control polcies (to be called by data providers):
		<a href="acl-set.txt">/auth/v1/acl/set</a>

	 3. Append to existing access control policies (to be called by data providers):
		<a href="acl-append.txt">/auth/v1/acl/append</a>

	 4. Get the current access control policies (to be called by data providers):
		<a href="acl.txt">/auth/v1/acl</a>

	 5. Validate an access token (to be called by resource servers):
		<a href="token-introspect.txt">/auth/v1/token/introspect</a>

	 6. Revoke tokens (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="token-revoke.txt">/auth/v1/token/revoke</a>

	 7. Revoke all tokens for a given certificate (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="token-revoke-all.txt">/auth/v1/token/revoke-all</a>

	 8. Audit tokens (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="audit-tokens.txt">/auth/v1/audit/tokens</a>

	 9. Add a consumer to a group (to be called by a data provider):
		<a href="group-add.txt">/auth/v1/group/add</a>

	10. Delete a consumer from a group (to be called by a data provider):
		<a href="group-delete.txt">/auth/v1/group/delete</a>

	11. List current consumers in a group (to be called by a data provider):
		<a href="group-list.txt">/auth/v1/group/list</a>

	12. Get the user's certificate details (can be called by both data providers and consumers):
		<a href="certificate-info.txt">/auth/v1/certificate-info</a>

<b>5. Authentication</b>

	All APIs require a valid client-side certificate (X.509).

	Data providers and consumers <b>must</b> have a valid <b>emailAddress</b> field in the certificate.

	Where as, the resource server's certificate must have a valid hostname (FQDN) as the <b>Common Name (CN)</b>.
	Also, for a resource server, the hostname in the certificate <b>must</b> match with the IP from where the API is being called.

	To get a certificate, please visit any of the following certificate authorities (CA):

		1. IUDX certificate authority : <a href=https://ca.iudx.org.in>https://ca.iudx.org.in</a>
		2. Any licensed CA in India   : <a href=http://cca.gov.in/licensed_ca.html>http://cca.gov.in/licensed_ca.html</a>
		3. Any standard trusted CA    : <a href=./ca-list.txt>List of trusted certificate authorities</a>

	<b>Please note that</b>: as of now, certificates issued by CAs other than <a href="https://ca.iudx.org.in">IUDX CA</a> will be considered as:

		class-1 for resource servers.
		class-2 for consumers.

	If you wish to get a class-3 or above certificate, please use the <a href=https://ca.iudx.org.in>IUDX CA</a> or your organization's IUDX-subCA.

<b>6. Certificate classes</b>

	There are 5 classes of certificates:

		class-1: Can only be used by resource servers to validate/introspect their tokens.
			 They can <b>only</b> be used to call the <a href="token-introspect.txt">/auth/v1/token/introspect</a> API.

		class-2: Can be used by a data consumer to request access to <b>protected</b> data.
			 They can <b>only</b> be used to call the <a href="token.txt">/auth/v1/token</a> API.

		class-3: Can be used by a <b>data consumer</b> to request access to <b>protected</b> data. 
			 Can be used by a <b>data provider</b> to set access control policies <b>and</b> create/manage catalog entries.

		class-4: Can be used by a data consumer to request access to <b>private</b> data.
		class-5: Can be used by a data consumer to request access to <b>confidential</b> data.
