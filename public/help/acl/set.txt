			FOR <n> <second(s)/minute(s)/week(s)/month(s)/year(s)>
			IF <condition> AND/OR <more-conditions>

	Examples:

		barun@iisc.ac.in can access resource-server.com/streetlights.SL1 for 2 hours

		arun.babu@rbcps.org, *@iisc.ac.in can access * if time > 18:00:00 and time < 24:00:00

		all can access resource-server.com/public.* if api = '/latest' AND country = "IN"

	It also supports conditions such as:

		ip = 10.0.0.1

		cert.cn like /* at IISc/i

		latitude > 20.03 AND longitude > 40.22

		time::day in (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)

		consumer-in-group("confidential")

	You may use a single "*", or "all", "everything", or "anything" to match any identifier; example:
