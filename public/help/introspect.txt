Token introspection
-------------------

Endpoint:
	https://<server>/auth/v1/introspect

Methods:
	POST

Description:
	This API is used to validate an access token provided by a consumer.

Called by:
	A "resource server" with a valid class-1 certificate.

Note:
	The "cn" of the resource server certificate should be valid hostname (FQDN) or IP address.
	And it must be ensured that the IP address of the "cn" matches with the machine that makes
	the introspect call.

	This is to ensure that only the user who owns the resource server can introspect its tokens.

Headers:
	content-type	: "application/json"

Body:
	token		: <token presented by the consumer>
	server-token	: <server token presented by the consumer>		// optional

HTTP response code:

	200
		If the token is valid

	403
		If the token is invalid/expired

	429
		If the resource-server makes too many requests

Using pyIUDX SDK:

	from pyIUDX.auth import auth	
	
	iudx_auth = auth.Auth("resource-server-certificate.pem","private-key.pem") 

	iudx_auth.introspect_token("auth.iudx.org.in/arun.babu@rbccps.org/2204adcbc990ffff234689aaabcdef90")
